General Graph class, implemented as an adjacency list.

Code repo includes:
  - Graph class Implementation
  - Visualizer when representing graphs in 3D space.
  - Implementations of several search algorithms.

Full credit for the utils files (such as the visualizer) goes to the staff of the advanced software dev class at Stanford. The Graph implementation is my own.
